#  Json Web Token Authentication  Implemention with Django
This is a boiler plate for future implementation of Registration using Json Web Token.
The plate can be forked and used direct, with constumization of admin email and password.

## What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
